# Traffic_Light_Arduino
Code to be run on two Arduino units that control a simulation of an intersection
The file motion_sensor.ino controls the traffic lights and detects when a car ignores a red light
The file motion_sensor_2.ino detects when a car is stopped in front of a red light and tells the other arduino to switch the lights
